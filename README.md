# 🌯 Burrito Productivity
## The ingredients (a.k.a. tools) for your productive life, powered by local-first AI, and wrapped up in one convenient, private, on-the-go package. Keep your data fresh, local, and private with Burrito Productivity.

Burrito Productivity is a modern, local-first productivity suite built for 2026. Unlike traditional apps that send your schedule, notes, and emails to the cloud, Burrito keeps your data where it belongs: **on your device.** Using advanced **Edge AI** and a multi-agent orchestration layer, Burrito provides deep intelligence without sending your data around the internet.

## ✨ The Menu (Core Features)

* **🌯 The Whole Wrap:** A unified view of your Calendar, Tasks, Emails, and Notes.
* **🧠 Brain-on-Device:** High-performance AI inference running directly on your device.
* **🛡️ Privacy-First Sync:** Peer-to-Peer (P2P) synchronization with End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). Your data never touches "the cloud".
* **🔍 Semantic Memory:** Smart search that understands the *meaning* of your notes, not just the keywords.
* **🤖 Agentic Sandboxing:** We know that AI can't be truly helpful unless you can trust that it won't ruin what it's supposed to be helping with. That's why Burrito AI drafts changes for you to approve. No surprises like deleted calendar events or an unwanted "Reply All".

## 🏗️ The Recipe (Tech Stack)

Burrito is being built with a cutting-edge, cross-platform stack. The outline below is subject to change as development progresses:

* **Language:** Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)
* **UI:** Compose Multiplatform (Android/Web/iOS)
* **AI Engine:** ExecuTorch (Mobile NPU) & WebGPU (Web)
* **Local Storage:** SQLite with `sqlite-vec` for high-speed vector search
* **Orchestration:** Custom "Hub & Brain" Multi-Agent architecture
* **Communication:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) for local tool integration

## 🛠️ How to Wrap Your DIY Burrito (Getting Started with the Code)

### Prerequisites

* **Android:** Device with NPU (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3+ recommended)
* **iOS:** iPhone 15 Pro or newer (Apple Neural Engine required)
* **Web:** A browser supporting WebGPU (Chrome 121+)


### COMING SOON: Steps (clone code, install dependencies per target platform, build for target platform, etc.)

## 🔬 Local AI Architecture

Burrito uses a unique **Hub vs. Brain** separation of concerns.

1. **The Hub:** The Kotlin "Operating System" that holds your context, manages the sandbox, and executes tools via MCP.
2. **The Brain:** Specialized models (1B and ~3B) that handle Intent Routing, Reasoning, and Logic Auditing (Criticism).
