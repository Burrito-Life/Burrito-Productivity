# 🌯 Burrito Productivity
## High-quality ingredients to supercharge your digital life, powered by Local-First Agentic AI, wrapped up in a convenient and delicious package!
### Keep your data fresh, local, and private with Burrito Life apps.
Agent-Native. Privacy-Forward. Local-First. Cloud-Optional.

Burrito Productivity is a modern, local-first productivity suite built for 2026 and beyond. Unlike traditional apps that send your schedule, notes, and emails to the cloud, Burrito keeps your data where it belongs: **on your device(s)**. Using advanced **Edge AI** and **Multi-Agent Orchestration**, Burrito provides deep intelligence without sending your data around the internet.

(Powered by [Burrito SDK](https://github.com/Burrito-Life/burrito-sdk).)

## ✨ The Menu (Core Features)

* **🌯 The Whole Wrap:** A unified view of your Calendar, Tasks, Emails, and Notes.
* **🧠 Brain-on-Device:** High-performance AI inference running directly on your device.
* **🛡️ Privacy-First Sync:** Peer-to-Peer (P2P) synchronization with End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). Your data never touches "the cloud".
* **🔍 Semantic Memory:** Smart search that understands the *meaning* of your notes, not just the keywords.
* **🤖 Agentic Sandboxing:** We know that AI can't be truly helpful unless you can trust that it won't ruin what it's supposed to be helping with. That's why Burrito AI drafts changes for you to approve. No surprises like deleted calendar events or an unwanted "Reply All".
